# ðŸ”§ Hardware Integration â€” SafeDrive: Driver Authentication System
### My Contribution to: `driving_licence_controlled_smart_vehicle`

As part of the SafeDrive system, my responsibility was to plan, wire, and assemble the physical hardware that enables driver authentication inside the vehicle.

## ðŸ§° My Role

I worked on the **hardware integration and physical wiring** of the embedded system. This includes:

- Planning connection layout between modules and the controller
- Assembling and testing each component
- Ensuring reliable communication (I2C, SPI, UART)
- Power supply management and pin protection

## âš¡ Power Supply

- All modules receive **regulated 5V** from a **buck converter** connected to the car's 12V battery.
- Used common GND rail for stable communication.
- Fuse added to power input for protection.
- Relay module isolated to avoid reverse current into Raspberry Pi.

---

## ðŸ”„ System Interaction (From Hardware POV)

1. User unlocks vehicle â†’ System powers on
2. Raspberry Pi waits for:
   - RFID Scan (via RC522)
   - Fingerprint match (via UART)
3. On success:
   - Relay triggers â†’ Engine ON
4. On impact detected:
   - GPS data fetched
   - GSM sends emergency alert SMS

---

## ðŸ§  Notes on Integration

- Signal noise avoided by separating UART lines across GPS, GSM, and fingerprint
- All UART devices tested one-by-one before final assembly
- Used jumper cables + pin headers + breadboard for testing
- Final setup prepared for vehicle dashboard fitting

## âœ… Summary of My Work

- ðŸ“Œ Assembled and wired entire hardware system
- ðŸ“Œ Mapped and verified all communication interfaces (SPI/UART/I2C)
- ðŸ“Œ Ensured safe power design with voltage regulators and fuse
- ðŸ“Œ Built the backbone that makes authentication logic possible

> This hardware infrastructure ensures the **SafeDrive software can run securely, accurately, and reliably**.
