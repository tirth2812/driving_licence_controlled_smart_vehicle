### My Contribution to Driving Licence Controlled Smart Vehicle – Multi-Factor Driver Authentication System (MFDAS)
As part of the SafeDrive system, my responsibility was to plan, wire, and assemble the physical hardware that enables driver authentication inside the vehicle.

## 🧰 My Role

I worked on the **hardware integration and physical wiring** of the embedded system. This includes:

- Planning connection layout between modules and the controller
- Assembling and testing each component
- Ensuring reliable communication (I2C, SPI, UART)
- Power supply management and pin protection

## ⚡ Power Supply

- All modules receive **regulated 5V** from a **buck converter** connected to the car's 12V battery.
- Common GND used across all modules for stable communication.
- Fuse added to power input for protection.
- Relay module isolated to avoid reverse current into Raspberry Pi.
- SIM800L given a separate regulated 4V supply to prevent Raspberry Pi brownouts.

---

## 🔄 System Interaction (From Hardware POV)

1. User unlocks vehicle → System powers on  
2. Raspberry Pi waits for:  
   - RFID Scan (via RC522)  
   - Fingerprint match (via UART)  
3. On success:  
   - Relay triggers → Engine ON  
4. On impact detected:  
   - GPS data fetched  
   - GSM sends emergency alert SMS  

---

## 🧠 Notes on Integration

- Avoided signal noise by separating UART lines for GPS, GSM, and fingerprint modules.
- Tested each UART device individually before full system assembly.
- Used jumper cables, pin headers, and breadboards during prototyping.
- Final wiring prepared for clean dashboard installation.
